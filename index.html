            <p>Having created online content on both this website and YouTube since 2012, I have received hundreds of calls and emails from Title Companies and Title sales reps. I’ve spoken to many of you and even “coached” some of you hopefully improving your knowledge and growing your business. I’ve found over the last few years, that the largest gap in the Title industry as it’s related to “sales” is the lack of <br><br>Too often the calls I receive sound the same. A Title rep is hired and thrown into the field with little to no training and expected to bring big results to their company. Being super successful in this job is tough, so I want to bring my expertise to you with Title Sales Coaching. Three months of training that allows you to get your business off the ground, learn how to acquire, convert and retain clients, social media training, teach high-value classes for Realtors, and of course…video!<a href="">read more</a></p>

            <h3 align="center">What Realtors Need to Know About iBuyers</h3><br><br>
            <p>I think we all can admit changes and disruptions have been making their way into the real estate industry. It seems every few months some innovation is trying to change how we do business. The move to the internet and technology–which I’ve talked about for the last 7 years on this site seems to be leading the way. The difference is I talk about how to leverage and use tech to expand your footprint and grow market share. This new form of tech disruption involves getting rid of the Realtor all together. This affects everyone in our industry in many major markets and soon to be nationwide. The iBuyer pandemic is sweeping the country, so much so, that it was the “item of value” mailer for all Brian Buffini coaching clients this month. If Buffini is telling his clients to push this information to their databases, that means something. Here is what Realtors need to know about ibuyers and how they can best educate their clients.<a href="">read more</a></p>

            <h3 align="center">3 Ways to Know Your Real Estate Online Presence Stinks</h3><br><br>
            <p>I’ve been in Title sales since 2005. Back then the phrase “get discovered online” or “build an online presence” wasn’t used very much. It was all about how many postcards can I blast out to a certain marketing area, or even buying a ton of ad space in real estate magazines. How times have changed…oh wait…for many Realtors, the times have not really changed that much…for them. They are still stuck marketing their business almost the exact same way, though consumer behavior has changed in a big way. People continually reach out to me saying they were “Googling something” or “found me on YouTube” Realtors still think that’s quite cute when I tell them of my success. In the meantime, they keep plugging along wondering why they are wasting marketing dollars. They struggle because their real estate online presence stinks. Our job, as Title salespeople, is to lift them up and show them how to be successful in the areas where they are lacking. Here are the three ways to know if as a Realtor, your real estate online presence stinks.<a href="">read more</a></p>
